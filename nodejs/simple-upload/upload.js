/// First we need to import the `createClient` function from the `w3up-client` package.

/// We also import the `packToBlob` function from the `ipfs-car` package, 
/// to create IPFS-formatted file objects and pack them into a Content Archive (CAR) for uploading. 
/// Note that this will likely be handled automatically by a future version of `w3up-client`.

/// in the current directory. See the `loadSettings` function below.
